Before you proceed...
  - Keep reading this. Seriously.
  - Note that we do not support forks (i.e. IceCat, Pale Moon, WaterFox, etc).
  - Make sure you searched for the `[Setup` tags in the `user.js`.
  - Search the GitHub repository. The information you need is most likely here already.
  - Check out our [troubleshooting](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.4-Troubleshooting) wiki page, including steps to see if the problem is caused by the `user.js` or an extension.

If you still need help, help us help you by providing relevant information:
  - browser version
  - Steps to Reproduce (STR)
  - actual result
  - expected result
  - anything else you deem worth mentioning

Clear all of this when you're ready to type.
