Before you ask for help...
  - Keep reading this. Seriously.
  - Note that we do not support forks (i.e. IceCat, Pale Moon, WaterFox, etc).
  - Make sure you searched for the setup tags in user.js.
  - Search the GitHub repository. The information you need is most likely here already.
  - See if you get the same problem in a new Firefox profile without user.js.
  - See if you get the same problem without extensions/add-ons.
  - Check out our wiki page on troubleshooting.
